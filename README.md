# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to be able to provide you an answer on how other Kickstarter fundraising campaigns fared. To provide you a clear analysis, we looked at the trends of Kickstarter campaign outcomes for the theater, and how they fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After narrowing the data to look at the trends of the theater fundraising outcomes, we then compared the number of fundraising campaigns that successfully met fundraising goals, failed to meet fundraising goals and campaigns that canceled based on the month of their start dates between 2009 and 2017. As shown in Figure 1., we found that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. In addition, we can also see that the after the spike in May, the number of successful campaigns launched decreases from 111 campaigns in May to 37 campaigns in December, which in comparison is almost equal to the 35 failed campaigns in December.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
