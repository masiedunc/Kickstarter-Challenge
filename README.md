# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to be able to provide you an answer on how other Kickstarter fundraising campaigns fared. To provide you a clear analysis, we looked at the trends of Kickstarter campaign outcomes for the theater, and how they fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data provided was narrowed down to generate insights for Kickstarter campaigns for Theater projects. We then compared the number of fundraiser outcomes that successfully met fundraising goals, failed to meet fundraising goals, and campaigns that were canceled based on the month of their start dates between 2009 and 2017. As shown in Figure 1., we found that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. In addition, we can also see that after the spike in May, the number of successful campaigns launched decreased from 111 campaigns in May to 37 campaigns in December, which in comparison is almost equal to the 35 failed campaigns in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After looking at data of the outcomes for Kickstarter fundraising campaigns of Theater projects based on launch date, we created a line graph, Figure 2, to compare the percentage of successful fundraising outcomes, failed fundraising outcomes, or canceled fundraisers based on their fundraising goals of Plays, specifically. We narrowed the focus to Plays in Great Britain and found that campaigns with fundraising goals of less than $1,000 had the highest success rate of 76% compared to the failed or canceled projects. The percentage of successful plays based on their funding goal seems to be higher between $1,000 and $4,999, yet as fundraising goals rose to around $5,000 or more, the percent of successful campaigns dipped as the percent of failed fundraisers began to spike. The percentage of failed fundraisers reached its highest at 80% for plays with fundraising goals between $25,000 and $29,000. Then we see, with the fundraising goal range of $40,000 to $44,999, the percentage of successful fundraisers increased to 67%, compared to the 33% that failed. However, between $45,000 to $49,999, 100% of all campaigns failed to meet fundraising goals. Interestingly, we found no canceled Kickstarters for plays within this data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We encountered some challenges within the large data set, to narrow the focus but still keep the population large enough to provide accurate Theater & Play data outcomes to generate insights. When specifically looking at theater projects and even more specifically, Plays, the smaller subset made it difficult to have insight into other reasons for why some campaigns were successful while others failed to reach their goals. 

## Results

Upon visual inspection of the line graph for the Theater outcomes based on launch date, we can see that there were more successful campaigns in May. This was followed by a significant decrease in successful campaigns leading to the fewest in the Fall and Winter months. Then if we look at the Outcomes of Plays, specifically, based on the fundraising goals, it seems that failed campaigns had higher fundraising goals compared to the successful campaigns.  Interestingly, we saw that the fundraising goal range of $40,000 to $44,999 had a higher percentage of successful campaigns, which leads us to question what other factors may play a role in meeting fundraising goals besides the price. With this information, we can conclude that a Kickstarter campaign will have a higher chance of successfully reaching the fundraising goal if launched in May with a smaller goal. 

One thing to make note of is that there were no canceled campaigns for Plays based on fundraising goals, which could be due to the limitations of looking at only the Plays in Great Britain, which is a smaller population compared to looking at the campaigns of plays worldwide. With this information we can assume that even though if campagins do not reach fundraising goals, they may stil lbe able to produce the project.

Some graphs that we could create to dig deeper into our analysis could be a line graph comparing the outcomes of campaigns for Plays in Great Britain compared to the United States. One other graph that may be helpful, would be a box plot looking at the pledged donations for successful and failed campaigns, to explore if there may have been other reasons why some campaigns did not meet their goals.
