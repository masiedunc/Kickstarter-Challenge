# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to be able to provide you an answer on how other Kickstarter fundraising campaigns fared. To provide you a clear analysis, we looked at the trends of Kickstarter campaign outcomes for the theater, and how they fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data provided was narrowed down to generate insights for Kickstarter campaigns for Theater projects. We then compared the number of fundraiser outcomes that successfully met fundraising goals, failed to meet fundraising goals, and campaigns that were canceled based on the month of their start dates between 2009 and 2017. As shown in Figure 1., we found that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. In addition, we can also see that after the spike in May, the number of successful campaigns launched decreased from 111 campaigns in May to 37 campaigns in December, which in comparison is almost equal to the 35 failed campaigns in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After looking at data of the outcomes for Kickstarter fundraising campaigns of plays based on launch date, we created a line graph, Figure 2, to compare the percentage of successful fundraising outcomes, failed fundraising outcomes, or canceled fundraisers based on their fundraising goals. We found that fundraising goals of less than $1,000 had the highest success rate of 76% compared to the failed or canceled projects. The percentage of successful plays based on their funding goal seems to be higher between $1,000 and $4,999, yet as fundraising goals rose to around $5,000 or more, the percent of successful campaigns dipped as the percent of failed fundraisers began to spike. The percentage of failed fundraisers reached its highest at 80% for plays with fundraising goals between $25,000 and $29,000. Then we see, with the fundraising goal range of $40,000 to $44,999, the percentage of successful fundraisers increased to 67%, compared to the 33% that failed. However, between $45,000 to $49,999, 100% of all campaigns failed to meet fundraising goals. Interestingly, we found no canceled Kickstarters for plays within this data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
